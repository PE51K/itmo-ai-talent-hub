\section{Problem 1}

\textbf{Problem.} Find the PDF of $Y = 1 - X^3$, where $X$ is the random variable distributed according to the Cauchy law, i.\ e.\ with the PDF
\[
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\pi(1 + x^2)}
\]

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 2}

\textbf{Problem.} Find the expected value and the variance of the random variable $Y = 2 - 3\sin X$, given that the PDF of $X$ is
\[
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{2}\cos x \text{ for } x \in \left[-\pi/2,\pi/2\right]
\]

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 3}

\textbf{Problem.} The random variable $X$ is defined on the entire real axis with the probability density $\phi(x)=\frac{1}{2}e^{-|x|}$. Find the probability density of the random variable $Y=X^2$ and its mathematical expectation.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 4}

\textbf{Problem.} Prove formally that if the correlation coefficient $\rho_{XY}$ of two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is equal in absolute value to one, then there is a linear functional relationship between these random variables.

Remember how to prove that $Cov(X,Y)\leq \sigma_X\sigma_Y$.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 5}

\textbf{Problem.} The distribution surface (joint PDF) of the two-dimensional random variable $(X,Y)$ is a right circular cone, the base of which is a circle centered at the origin with a unit radius. Outside this circle, the joint PDF of this two-dimensional random variable $(X,Y)$ is zero. Find the joint PDF $f(x,y)$, the marginal PDFs and the conditional PDFs $f_x(y)$ and $f_y(x)$. Are the random variables $X$ and $Y$ dependent and/or correlated?

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 6}

\textbf{Problem.} Let $X$ and $Y$ be continuous random variables with a (spherically symmetric) joint PDF of the form $f(x,y)=g(x^2+y^2)$ for some function $g$. Let $(R,\theta)$ be the polar coordinates of $(X,Y)$, so that $R^2=X^2+Y^2$ is the squared distance from the origin and $\theta$ is the angle $\in[0,2\pi)$, with $X=R\cos\theta$, $Y=R\sin\theta$.

a) Prove that $R$ and $\theta$ are independent and explain intuitively why this result makes sense;

b) What is the joint PDF of $(R,\theta)$ if $(X,Y)$ is Uniform on the unit disk, i.\ e.\ $x^2+y^2\leq 1$? If $X,Y$ are i.\ i.\ d.\ $N(0,1)$?

\textbf{Solution.}
