\section{Problem 1}

\textbf{Problem.} Find the variance of $X \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n,p)$ using indicator random variables $I_j$ such that $X = I_1 + I_2 + \cdots + I_n$.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 2}

\textbf{Problem.} Derive the Poisson expectation and variance from its PMF.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 3}

\textbf{Problem.} Find the mode, median, and expected value of a random variable $X$ with PDF $\varphi(x) = 3x^{2}$, where $x \in [0,1]$. Note: mode, $Mo(X)$, is the “most probable” (in some sense) value of $X$, i.e.\ the maximum of PMF/PDF. The median, $Me(X)$, is $F^{-1}(1/2)$ for $X$ with CDF $F$.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 4}

\textbf{Problem.} Assume that the device repair time is a random variable $X \sim \mathrm{Expo}(\lambda)$. Find the probability that the device repair will take at least $20$ days if the average device repair time is $15$ days.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 5}

\textbf{Problem.} Consider the Negative Hypergeometric distribution with parameters $w$, $b$, and $r$: an urn contains $w$ white balls and $b$ black balls, which are randomly drawn one by one without replacement, until $r$ white balls have been obtained. Assuming $r \le w$, we say that the number of black balls drawn before drawing the $r$-th white ball $X \sim \mathrm{NHGeom}(w,b,r)$. Find the $E(X)$ using indicator random variables.

\textbf{Solution.}

\section{Problem 6}

\textbf{Problem.} CSuppose that Bernoulli trials are being performed in
continuous time; i.e.\ the trials take place at points on a timeline. Assume that
the trials are at regularly spaced times $0, \Delta t, 2\Delta t, \ldots$, where
$t$ is a small positive number. Let the probability of success of each trial be
$\lambda \Delta t$, where $\lambda$ is a positive constant. Let $G$ be the number
of failures before the first success in discrete time, and $T$ be the time of the
first success (in continuous time).

(a) Relate $G$ to $T$ and find the CDF of $T$.

(b) Show that as $\Delta t \to 0$, the CDF of $T$ converges to the $\mathrm{Expo}(\lambda)$
CDF, evaluating all the CDFs at a fixed $t \ge 0$.

\textbf{Solution.}
